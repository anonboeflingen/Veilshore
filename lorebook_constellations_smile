### Description
A tavern built from shipwreck timber and sea-worn bone, shaped like an inverted hull and glowing against the storm. Lanterns sway like fallen stars, and bottles behind the bar hold faint, living light.

The place feels like arrival — as if the sea exhales and says *you made it*.

### Notes
- Driftwood beams carved with sailor prayers and old wagers  
- Lanterns and bottles glow brighter during storms  
- Mismatched tables etched with names, debts, and promises  
- Light refracts through thick sea-glass in gold and turquoise waves  

### Usage Notes (for AI)
- Used as a meeting ground, sanctuary, and cultural heart  
- Encourages confession, storytelling, plotting, and reunion  
- Joy and melancholy should always coexist here  
- The tavern feels alive but never intrusive; it listens more than it speaks
